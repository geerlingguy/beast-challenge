Station App needs to do the following:

  1. Monitor for button presses, forward those via HTTP to central server /vote endpoint
  2. Request room color from central server (default to white), set that on relay
  3. Request button LED lights (which to light) from central server (default to off), set that on GPIO
  4. At startup (maybe separate script that runs at boot), cycle through relay colors and then turn off
